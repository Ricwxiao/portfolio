# Ricwxiao's Porfolio
Hello, welcome! :) This is simply the portfolio of Ricwxiao, my personal portfolio. Sorry I really don't know what else I can say here. 

I got interested in web-dev when I was having class with Prof. Scott Barker at the University of Washington in Seattle. By web-dev, I really mean the little half-hour session on HTML and a tiny little bit of CSS. I had no experience 
with coding at all, but this session had lit up the fire in my heart about coding. I felt so successful and satisfied when finishing the ugly HTML website after the session. 

After this enlightenment, I went on to learn a lot more other coding languages -- `java`, `python`, and much more advanced web-dev teniques with `React.js`. Yet, I am a Fundamentalist in web-dev. I always love the simplicity of HTML, CSS, and only necessary Javascripts. That's why I decided to take this format as my personal website. That's all for my introduction. Enjoy your time!
